We could use a ton of security on our smartphones like biometric authentication using **Face** and **Fingerprint** recognition.
But our **desktops** and **laptops** have lagged behind. So, here we
need Face Protect a facial authenticator to protect our apps & data on our Desktops & Laptops, and the best part is, it works *offline*.
